# Review
Power Stone 2 is a fighting game for the Sega Dreamcast. Created by Capcom this sequel to the original Power Stone has a few interesting features. There are a few things here and there I believe need to be checked or reevaluated. 

## Collision detection 
In certain levels there is an invisible wall that should stop you in order to force you towards a path. One level in particular there are submarines you ride until you reach an iceberg. When on the submarine in the iceberg area you can cause the invisible to push you through the sub and be in the water. I'm pretty sure that should not be happening.

### Recovery/Invincibility
There are many times when fighting in a few stages some hazards can be found and interacted with. when hit by one you can be knocked into a knock down animation which can be recovered from by pressing the jump or action button. Now in other games you have brief invincibility for maybe 2-3 seconds. This game has it be less than that to where you could get juggled by the hazard nearly to death if you arent careful.

#### Item mixing issue
Within Power Stone 2 there is an item shop that effects what kind of items may pop up in game modes. In the shop there is an option to mix items together for the possibility of new items appearing. Successful mixes are kept in a catalog to remind you of what you mixed to get a item. Issue is sometimes the mix will fail for an unknown reason even if you a recipe for an item which certain ones require you have before you can even try to make them.
